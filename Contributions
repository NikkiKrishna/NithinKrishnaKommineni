I personally contributed by brainstorming what data we should take for the initial EDA. I then did a Random Forest analysis for the model. 
I wanted to focus on existing customers as a whole, amp up their experience and make sure that they referred more people. 
I would do more EDA, run more models and see what were the best suiters tailed to your need. I wouldn’t dismiss any specific datasets without multiple tests and correlations.
