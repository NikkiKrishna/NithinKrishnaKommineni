**Churn Predictions** 
When we are accessing induvial customers, we can focus on instant outputs as the algorithm does not need to be extensively manipulated. 
Using weekly scoring on demand and other variables in a dashboard would be a lot better as daily or small burst of trends could be meaningless.
I believe python is very versatile and can be extremely useful in running high level scheduled predictions.
I would check three area for trust worthiness of the churn model by monitoring 2 factors. The first would be data quality check, essentially checking missing values, invalid inputs, clean and complete data.  Secondly, tacking the model performance metrics such as AUC, predicted churn and actual churn, and accuracy.
