Customer Churn Rate Project Class of 2026

The data we are working on is from a company that provides internet and other services. We are trying solve why they are facing a customer churn problem. After analyzing the data, we want to give the board of directors a few solid recommendations

From our data we saw that there is a high churn rate with month to month customers, fiber optics/add on customers and customers who had low refferals. 
A simple way to run our code is to open up a platfrom where you can run python code with inbuilt libraries. Download the prebuild libraries. Then line by line run the code.  

One limitation that the stakeholder should know is, we binned come coloums of the data to make it cleaner and we didnt use that had alof missing values.
